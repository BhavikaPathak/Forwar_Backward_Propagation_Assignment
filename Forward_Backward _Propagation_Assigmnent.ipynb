    "Forward propagation is the process through which input data is passed through a neural network to generate an output. It involves computing the weighted sum of inputs, applying activation functions to these sums, and passing the results to the next layer. The purpose of forward propagation is to produce predictions or activations that the network outputs based on the given input data and the learned parameters (weights and biases)."

    "Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the neural network, allowing it to model complex relationships in the data. They determine whether a neuron should be activated (fire) or not based on the weighted sum of inputs. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and softmax. They transform the output of each neuron to a certain range or value, which forms the activations of that layer and becomes the input for the next layer during forward propagation."

    "Weights and biases are the learnable parameters of a neural network. During forward propagation, the weighted sum of inputs (including biases) is computed and passed through an activation function. The weights determine the strength of connections between neurons, while biases allow the activation function to be shifted up or down. Adjusting these parameters through training enables the network to learn and make accurate predictions."

    "The softmax function is used in the output layer of a neural network when dealing with multi-class classification problems. It converts the raw scores (logits) produced by the network into probabilities. These probabilities represent the likelihood of the input belonging to each class. Softmax ensures that the predicted class probabilities sum up to 1, making it easier to interpret the network's output as class probabilities."

    "The chain rule is a fundamental rule in calculus that states how to calculate the derivative of a composite function. In the context of neural networks, the chain rule is used to calculate gradients in multi-layer networks during backpropagation. It breaks down the gradient of the final output with respect to the initial input into a series of gradients in each layer. This allows us to compute the impact of changes in parameters on the overall loss."

    "Vanishing Gradient: This occurs when gradients become extremely small, hindering the learning process in deep networks. Using non-saturating activation functions like ReLU and its variants can mitigate this issue.\n",
